# ENGL-343-Final-Project

This is where I've uploaded(to the best of my abilities) the entirity of my coding work so far on the project. I have labelled the Jupyter Notebooks in order of date, and have tried to include code comments that explain everything that is going. Some Notebooks are a bit messy and haphazard, though I've deliberately elected to maintain this in an effort to preserve some record of my coding progression.

Due to file size limits on GitHub, all the data(novel files, word counts, excel tables, etc) for this project can be found here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1x7vlLbb8IatX86nSgSNkMz70AgTGYKap?usp=sharing

Lastly, I have attempted to properly censor any potentially offending code comments, as I do have a habit of typing direct from mind to keyboard. One variable unfortunately cannot be changed.
